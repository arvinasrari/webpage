If colors had temperatures you could feel, what would blue say about your morning?
When a shadow separates from its object for one night, where does yours go first?
What shape does silence take when it sits beside you?
What pattern keeps repeating until you name it out loud?
The universe offers you a patch noteâ€”what tiny fix changes everything?
