lose keys at door
forgot phone at home
alarm clock too loud
stuck jacket zipper
spill hot coffee
eat very spicy food
sneeze many times
mosquito bite itch
lift heavy box
umbrella flips in wind
wait long for bus
late for meeting
printer has no paper
computer freezes
untangle headphones
wrong password again
low battery panic
take group selfie
find money on street
lost wallet check pockets
ice cream melting
shoelace keeps untying
dog chases playfully
rock baby to sleep
horror movie jump scare
win small prize
celebrate friend's birthday
airplane shaking
stuck in elevator
first date nervous
